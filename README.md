# MillerFinalProject
Caleb Miller's Final Project for RNR596

This project is for Data Wrangling in R Spring 2025. My project will be about
comparing the different species compositions of Arizonan National Parks, specifically
about certain vegetative and wildlife trends. Hopefully I will be able to see some changes
in how vegetation (like grama grasses) will affect the wildlife composition (like
elk or deer).

My project will have both DataRaw and DataClean under a Data folder, where Raw
will have crude, unmodified data and Clean will have cleaned, modified data.

Scripts will house my actual codes and R scripts.

Documents will have any supporting documents or papers that relate to the project.

Plots will have any plots or graphs I make for the project.
