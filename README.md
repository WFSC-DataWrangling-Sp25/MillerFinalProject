# MillerFinalProject

Caleb Miller's Final Project for RNR596

This project is for Data Wrangling in R Spring 2025. My project will be
about comparing the tree phenologies with the data provided by Dr
Bledsoe.

*REVIEW: I think providing some more information about the data set you
are using could be really helpful For example, why are there separate
files? What kinds of variables are involved? And maybe most importantly,
what is your objective with this R project? It totally makes sense that
you might not have this plan ironed out yet, but I think it would be
really nice once you do figure it out*

A quick note: I tend to prefer UpperCamelCase when naming my stuff,
opposed to the snake_case. It's just how my brain works and what is most
convenient for

My project will have both DataRaw and DataClean under a Data folder,
where Raw will have crude, unmodified data and Clean will have cleaned,
modified data. There isn't much stuff in the Clean folder, but in the
Raw folder, there is an XLSX folder and a CSV folder, where it will have
the excel sheets needed for this code, and the CSV folder will have the
converted excel documents in CSV (they will be converted using the
code).

Scripts will house my actual codes and R scripts.

Documents will have any supporting documents or papers that relate to
the project.

Plots will have any plots or graphs I make for the project.
