# MillerFinalProject
Caleb Miller's Final Project for RNR596

This project is for Data Wrangling in R Spring 2025. My project will be about
comparing the tree phenologies with the data provided by Dr Bledsoe.

A quick note: I tend to prefer UpperCamelCase when naming my stuff, opposed to 
the snake_case. It's just how my brain works and what is most convenient for 

My project will have both DataRaw and DataClean under a Data folder, where Raw
will have crude, unmodified data and Clean will have cleaned, modified data.
There isn't much stuff in the Clean folder, but in the Raw folder, there is an
XLSX folder and a CSV folder, where it will have the excel sheets needed for
this code, and the CSV folder will have the converted excel documents in CSV (they
will be converted using the code).

Scripts will house my actual codes and R scripts.

Documents will have any supporting documents or papers that relate to the project.

Plots will have any plots or graphs I make for the project.
