# MillerFinalProject

Caleb Miller's Final Project for RNR596

This project is for Data Wrangling in R Spring 2025. My project will be
about comparing the tree phenologies with the data provided by Dr
Bledsoe. The phenology describes the dates that certain species of trees'
leaf out, and the stages of that leaf (budforming, bud opening, leaf expanding).
I plan on comparing the phenology of the different tree by creating a graph
showing how many of each species were in the growing season in each phenology
class.

A quick note: I tend to prefer UpperCamelCase when naming my stuff,
opposed to the snake_case. It's just how my brain works and what is most
convenient for

My project will have both DataRaw and DataClean under a Data folder,
where Raw will have crude, unmodified data and Clean will have cleaned,
modified data. There isn't much stuff in the Clean folder, but in the
Raw folder, there is an XLSX folder and a CSV folder, where it will have
the excel sheets needed for this code, and the CSV folder will have the
converted excel documents in CSV (they will be converted using the
code).

Scripts will house my actual codes and R scripts.

Documents will have any supporting documents or papers that relate to
the project.

Plots will have any plots or graphs I make for the project.

Specific points where I demonstrated certain weeks' skills can be found here:

Week 4: 138
Week 5: 238
Week 6: 150
Week 7: 117
Week 11: 110
Week 12: 220
Week 13: 60

I've excluded Weeks 8 - 10 because they focus more on the construction of projects
and documents in R itself, so I'll assume their presence answers the requirements.
